# PROST

Planning, Reporting, Ordering, Stock, Tally (web app aimed primarily at volunteer associations)

This is a web application for associations to manage their drinks and snacks. It is aimed at

also aimed at associations that want to keep track of their members' debts and credits.

## Use cases:

- Create members (invitation via one-time-link)
- Create a tally (printable template)
- Keeping a balance sheet of the members
- Provide members with insight (own balance sheet only, payment options)
- Create a stock (add new items, remove items, etc.)
- Order from suppliers (if API available)
- Input invoices
- Keep balance sheet of the association
- Price calculation for internal sales
- Price calculation for external sales
- Calculation for exchange of goods between associations
- Reporting (e.g. sales per day, week, month, year, loss of bottles, etc.)

## Versioning and Branch-Strategy

Branch-conventions:

- `main`: Contains stabile version for production.
- `dev`: Contains features and bugfixes used for testing.
  Versioning strategies:
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
    - **PATCH** is incremented for bugfixes.
    - **MINOR** is incremented for new features without breaking changes.
    - **MAJOR** is incremented manually for breaking changes.
- Automatic incrementation via labels on PRs into `dev`.
- Only one of the following labels can be set at a time:
    - `breaking-changes`
    - `feature`
    - `bugfix`

## How to start dev env local
TODO: update
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.dev -p "dev_prost" -f "./docker/docker-compose.dev.yaml" up
```

## How to start prod env local

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -p "prod_prost" -f "./docker/docker-compose.prod.yaml" up
```

## Keycloak

- Container is available at either `http://dev-prost-keycloak.local:8081` or `http://prod-prost-keycloak.local:8081`
- Entry in host file is required
- User registration is enabled (only through browser ðŸ˜ª)
- Mapping of Keycloak users with Domain users is done via an event listener plugin in keycloak
- As a result, the event listener calls the backend API through the `host.docker.internal` or `backend` hostname to
  access the locally
  running backend (local development only) or in container (dev/production)

```bash
127.0.0.1 dev-prost-keycloak.local
127.0.0.1 prod-prost-keycloak.local
127.0.0.1 prost-keycloak.local
```
